<h2> Project Architecture Overview</h2>
<h3> 1. Front-End Development</h3>
<b>HTML, React.js, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript:</b> These technologies are utilized to build the front-end of the system, providing a modern, responsive interface for users.</br>

<h3>Back-End Development</h3>
<b>Solidity:</b>  Solidity is used to implement smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, governing various aspects of the donation system.</br>
<b>Ethereum and Polygon:</b>  Ethereum serves as the primary blockchain platform, while Polygon provides a layer-2 scaling solution, enhancing transaction speed and cost efficiency.</br>
<b>Hardhat:</b>  Hardhat is used as a development environment for compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts, ensuring the reliability and functionality of the system.</br>

<h3>Middleware Integration</h3>
<b>Web3.js:</b> Web3.js facilitates communication between the front-end and the Ethereum blockchain, enabling seamless interaction with smart contracts.</br>
<b>Ethereum-waffle and Ethers:</b> These libraries simplify the testing and interaction with Ethereum smart contracts, enhancing the development process and user experience.</br>

<h3>Other Integrations</h3>
<b>IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):</b> IPFS is integrated for decentralized file storage, allowing users to store and retrieve images and media files securely.</br>
<b>Social Media Platforms:</b> Integration with social media platforms enables users to share donation events and promote wider participation.</br>


<h2>System Architecture</h2>
The DonateBlocks platform architecture comprises smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. DonationEvent contracts are created by donors to govern donation processes, while DonationTracking contracts provide a public record of donations received by recipient organizations. Users interact with these contracts through a user interface, enabling seamless donation processes and transparent tracking of donations.</br>
